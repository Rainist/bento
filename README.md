# bento
food (env) to be delivered (via slack) to travis

## Why?
- adding common set of env into every travis repository is sometimes inevitable.
- repetitive means automatable
- eliminate the needs of confirming from admin (and possibly actually them inputing for requester)
- and none of the requesters and admins need to see the senstive values any more unnecessarily

## Interface
- slack
> possibly more later

## Target
- travis
> possibly more later

## Stragtegy
- Lambda like serverless function way
- providing the deployment in k8s via kubeless is first-class citizen
